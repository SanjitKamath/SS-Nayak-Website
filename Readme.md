# S S Nayak & Associates — Static GitHub Pages site

This repository is a static website that fetches content from Markdown files in the `content/` folder and renders them in the browser.

## How to use / edit content

- Edit the files in `content/` (about.md, services.md, partners.md, contact.md) and push to GitHub.
- The website will render the updated markdown automatically (after GitHub Pages deploy).

## Deploy on GitHub Pages

1. Create a repository on GitHub and push this project to the `main` (or `master`) branch.
2. In the repository settings → Pages → Source: choose `main` branch `/ (root)`.
3. Save — GitHub Pages will build the site and provide a URL like `https://<username>.github.io/<repo>/`.

If you prefer the site to be at the root (no repo name in URL), enable Pages for `main` branch and choose the repo `username.github.io`.
